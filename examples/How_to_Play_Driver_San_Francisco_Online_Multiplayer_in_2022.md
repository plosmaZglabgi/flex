However, in 2022, Ubisoft announced that they would be shutting down the servers for Driver San Francisco, along with several other games. This meant that the online multiplayer mode would no longer be available for players who wanted to enjoy the game with their friends or other racers around the world.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to play Driver San Francisco online multiplayer in 2022, thanks to a tool called Alcatraz. Alcatraz is a fan-made project that re-enables the online multiplayer mode of Driver San Francisco by creating a custom server and patching the game files. With Alcatraz, you can play Driver San Francisco online multiplayer in 2022 with anyone who has the tool installed.
 
## How to Install Alcatraz
 
To install Alcatraz, you will need to have a copy of Driver San Francisco on your PC. You can buy the game from Steam or Ubisoft Connect, or use any other legitimate source. You will also need to download the Alcatraz files from [this link](https://github.com/ReHamster/Alcatraz/releases). The latest version as of writing this article is v0.3.0.
 
Once you have downloaded the Alcatraz files, you will need to extract them to your Driver San Francisco folder. The default location for this folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Driver San Francisco. You should see a new folder called Alcatraz inside your Driver San Francisco folder.
 
Next, you will need to run the Alcatraz.exe file as administrator. This will launch the Alcatraz launcher, which will patch your game files and connect you to the custom server. You will see a message saying "Patching successful" if everything goes well.
 
Finally, you will need to launch Driver San Francisco from the Alcatraz launcher by clicking on the Play button. This will start the game with the online multiplayer mode enabled. You can now join or create online matches from the main menu of the game.
 
## How to Play Driver San Francisco Online Multiplayer
 
To play Driver San Francisco online multiplayer, you will need to select the Online option from the main menu of the game. This will take you to the online lobby, where you can see other players who are online and join or create matches.
 
You can choose from different game modes such as Free-For-All, Team Race, Capture The Flag, Takedown, Tag, TrailBlazer, and Sprint GP. Each game mode has its own rules and objectives, and you can customize them according to your preferences. You can also invite your friends to join your matches by sending them an invite code from the Alcatraz launcher.
 
One of the most popular game modes is Takedown, where one player is the getaway driver and the rest are the police. The getaway driver has to score points by dropping off packages at different locations, while the police have to stop them by ramming their car or using abilities such as EMP or roadblocks. The roles switch after each round, and the team with the most points wins.
 
To reach multiplayer level 38, which is required for unlocking the Master achievement, you will need to earn XP by playing online matches and completing challenges. You can earn more XP by performing well in each match, such as scoring points, taking down opponents, or winning races. You can also earn XP by completing daily and weekly challenges that are randomly assigned to you.
 
According to some players who have reached level 38 using Alcatraz, it takes about 40-50 hours of playing time to achieve this goal. However, this may vary depending on your skill level and how often you play online. The best way to level up fast is to play with a full lobby of players and focus on scoring points rather than destroying cars.
